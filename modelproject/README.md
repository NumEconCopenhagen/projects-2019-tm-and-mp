# Modelproject

We start by solving the basic Solow-model.
- Finding the FOC
- Finding steady state values for k and y
- Plotting the transition diagram
- Using a widget to plot an interactive transition diagram in which the user can change parameter values
  These sliders does not work in GitHub, but by opening the notebook in Anaconda-Navigator as a Jupyter Notebook the sliders      
  work fine.
  
Next, we solve the Solow-model with land.
- Finding the FOC
- Finding steady state values for z and y
